Vague idea:
    why:
        provide data samples and lists
            to development projects and to study programming
    how:
        collect sample data items, lists and links to useful datasets
            see-example: "quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
            see-example: https://lipsum.com/ "Lorem Ipsum"
            see-example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob
        it could be done in simple text files,
            but I am now thinking of a html site and maybe json data files
        pages:
            index
                title and short description (what is this site),
                    also access to about (site meta information) page
                highlighted content
                    also access to site map, and all contents
            about
                description (what is this site)
                author, copyright?
            site-map
                maybe
                or just a navbar as long as there are only few pages
            data-access
                idea-A
                    one dynamic page with loads of js
                idea-B
                    split to many pages
            test-pages
                use cases and actual study
        direct datasets:
            json files
